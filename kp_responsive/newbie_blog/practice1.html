            Hi there this is my first responsive blog I am gonna share few of my experiences learning web dev in this course.
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>The first thing CSS sucks ya I have been suffering badly with CSS and to deal with it I finally decided to take the course of Kevin Powell the CSS guru to learn and implement it.</li>
            <li>Okay so the frustration is out, lets come to the margins, one cool thing to make your content look good. It helps you separate them. Also a tool to make your layout look good. The property of margin collapsing is a real cool to take advantage of.</li>
            <li>Hyperlinks are all that make the web the way it is and also soemthing interactive engaging the vistiors. The links have to be awesomely styled and that can be achieved through the states of the link:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Link: default state</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Visited: a link visited</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Hover: on mouse over</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Focus: on tab</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Active: when clicked</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lets talk of the inline elements well well they are something very polite and self sufficient for themseleves in the terms that they take up only the required amount space the content requires. There are few inline elements the <code>&lt;a&gt; </code><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>Talking of the inline elements, well they respect the padding, marging, borders for the left and the right side only, so dont bang your trying to put them on with the top and bottom side expecting some magic to happen. Well thats few things from todays learning see you again with more stuff soon.</li>
