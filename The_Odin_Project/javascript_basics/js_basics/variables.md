# Variables are "named storage containers" to store data.
We can imagine variable as a box labeled 'message'.
It contains a value "Hello".
We can put any value in the box.
When the value is changed the old data is removed from the varaiable.
We can also copy data from one variable to other.

## How do you declare a variable?
var var_name; //variable declaration
var_name = "Hello"; //variable assignment.

## What are three different ways to declare a variable?
Variables can be declared using the keywords: var, let, const.

## Which one should you use when?
1. var can be used to name any variable that can be changed or reassigned. It also allows redeclaration with the same name.
2. let is used when we need to reassign values to variable. It does not allow re-declaration.
3. const is used to declare constants. re-assignement gives error. Difficult to remeber values that are known prior to execution are named using capital letter and underscores.

## What are the rules for naming variables?
1. The name must conatain only letters, digits or the symbols-($,_).
2. The first character must not be a digit.

# When name contains multiple words camelCase is commonly used. First starting letter capital.
JS: variable names are case sensitive.
Do not use reserved words for the names.
Unless and until we use strict in our code variables can be assigned value and used without declaring them.

# A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.
Use of descriptive names instead of abbreviations is good practice helps in debugging.
