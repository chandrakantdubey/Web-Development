# Chandrakant's Web Development Jounrey

Hi, my name is Chandrakant and this is a repo of my mini projects that I built learning web-devlopment not all are mine.

This repository is built to include all my lessons from my classes, things I learn from youtube and other websites.

It is free to use by anyone to learn and build some projects, fork-it, create by looking at the projects want to make changes make a pull-request.

12-04-2023: I am making my second last commit to this repo! 
There are few projects in my hard drive that I may push at the weekend 15-03-2023, but no more on this.
I am keeping this repo as reminder of my struggles learning to code ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
